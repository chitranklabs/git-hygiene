## Security Practices

`git-hygiene` is built with a **Security-First** mindset:

- **Egress Lockdown**: CI/CD runners are restricted to known endpoints.
- **Dependency Auditing**: Automated OSV scanning on every PR.
- **Secret Scanning**: Gitleaks integrated into local hooks and CI.
- **Minimal Surface**: We use the principle of least privilege for all cloud and CI tokens.
- **SHA Pinning**: All GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.

Thank you for helping keep `git-hygiene` secure! 🛡️✨
